Supporting Web has been on my list since day 0 ([issue #11](https://github.com/gorhom/react-native-bottom-sheet/issues/11)), but unfortunately was not a priority until the community start adopting solutions such as [Expo Web](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/web/), which also provided an easier development setup for me to kick off the development.

With **v5** release, users will be able to use the library in web mobile without changing the API ü™Ñ.


import useBaseUrl from "@docusaurus/useBaseUrl";
import Video from "@theme/Video";

<Video

  url={useBaseUrl("video/bottom-sheet-web-support-preview.mp4")}
/>

### Setup 

In order to use the bottom sheet on web, you would need to follow the instructions from [Reanimated documentation](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/guides/web-support/).
