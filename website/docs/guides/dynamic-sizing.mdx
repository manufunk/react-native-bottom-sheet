Dynamic Sizing is one of the powerful feature that `v5` introduces, where the library internally managed to calculate static views and list content size height and set it as the bottom sheet content height.

:::info

The mechanism was introduce previously with [useBottomSheetDynamicSnapPoints](https://gorhom.dev/react-native-bottom-sheet/v4/hooks#usebottomsheetdynamicsnappoints) hook which been deprecated with the new release.

### Usage 

In order to enable the dynamic sizing to work properly, you would need to follow these rules:

1. Use the pre-configured [Scrollables](./scrollables) views, including the static view [BottomSheetView](./components/bottomsheetview).
2. In order to prevent the bottom sheet a exceeding certain height, you will need to set [`maxDynamicContentSize`](./props#maxdynamiccontentsize) prop.

And remember, you can always disable the feature if its not needed by overriding the prop [`enableDynamicSizing`](./props#enabledynamicsizing) with `false`.
